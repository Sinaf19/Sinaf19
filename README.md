## 👋 Hey there, I'm Quentin!

Welcome to my GitHub! Here's a little about me and what you'll find here.

### 💻 About Me
```java
public class Developer {
    String name = "Quentin";
    String[] favoriteLanguages = {"Java", "Swift", "Rust"};
    String favoriteActivity = "Turning ideas into evolving solutions";
    
    public void code() {
        System.out.println("Solving real-world problems with code.");
    }
}
```

- Java enthusiast ☕, coding with it like a second language.
- Always exploring new territories: currently diving into Swift 🍏 and Rust 🦀.
- Web development is my playground – I enjoy building creative and sometimes quirky projects on the web.
- I love tackling science-related problems with the help of my IT skills. Solving puzzles? Count me in! 🔍

### 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

- Java – My go-to language for solid, reliable code.
- Swift – Learning the ins and outs of iOS development.
- Rust – For when I want to make things fast and memory-safe.
- Web Development – HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the fun frameworks that make things happen on the web.
- Python, MongoDB – When it’s time to handle data or do some backend magic.

### 🌱 Always Learning

I’m passionate about keeping my skills sharp and discovering new technologies. Whether it's a new programming language, a framework, or just a cool tool – if it helps me build better solutions, I’m interested.

### 🚀 Projects & Goals

- Working on fun, experimental web projects – nothing too serious, just some ideas that make coding fun.
- Building scalable solutions that can adapt and grow over time.
- And yes, you might find a project or two that tackles science problems using IT tools.
